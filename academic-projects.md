1. **Modeling and Forecasting Volatility of Stock Index Financial Series and Volatility Spillover Effect in EViews: GARCH Families Approach**

[![Tableau Visualization](/img/volatility.jpg)](/img/volatility.jpg)

   - Funded by: [The Deans' Undergraduate Research Fund (DURF)](https://shanghai.nyu.edu/content/deans-undergraduate-research-fund-durf)
   - Software: Eviews, Python
   - Abstract: As the COVID-19 pandemic spread around the globe, financial markets—especially in the Asia-Pacific region—experienced heightened fear and volatility. We apply a suite of GARCH-family models (GARCH(1,1), EGARCH, GJR-GARCH) to measure risk persistence and leverage effects across China and its top five trading partners, then perform in-sample volatility forecasts for 2022 using 2015–2021 data to identify the best model per market. Finally, we employ a diagonal BEKK-GARCH to quantify volatility spillovers between China and each partner region. Our results reveal that China’s market is most tightly linked with Hong Kong’s, followed by Japan, Korea, and Taiwan, and least correlated with the U.S. market—insights that can inform policy coordination and trading strategies during future outbreaks.

1. **Tableau Information Visualization**

[![Tableau Visualization](/img/tableau.png)](/img/tableau.png)

   - Software: Tableau
   - This is the Tableau visualization project for course competition of Information Technology in Business & Society course at NYU Stern. I created a dual‐mode (light & dark) Tableau dashboard to explore Toy Data’s sales performance across regions, states, product lines, suppliers, statuses, and top products. A year‐parameter lets users toggle between years, while custom calculated fields drive color‐coded year-over-year growth, max/min markers, and dynamic rankings. Advanced techniques—dual axes, transparent map overlays, and rich tooltips—make it easy to spot trends and drill into details, delivering an interactive, polished visualization experience.
