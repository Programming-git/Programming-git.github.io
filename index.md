# Welcome to my personal webpage!

Hello there! I’m Kexin Deng, a Master’s candidate in Financial Engineering at Cornell University. Before coming to Ithaca I studied Data Science and Finance at NYU Shanghai, where I first fell in love with the power of numbers to illuminate markets and guide real-world decisions. My technical toolkit spans Python, R, and CVXPY—and I’ve built everything from Monte Carlo simulators for option pricing to quadratic‐programming optimizers for portfolio allocation. Most recently, I led a project extracting limit‐order‐book features (order flow, momentum, cancellation rates) across five major equities and translated those signals into a prototype execution strategy.

Beyond code, I’m also a storyteller. As president and lead author for NYU Shanghai Flame—a student‐run publication connecting top universities across Greater China and beyond—I wrote and edited in‐depth profiles and interviews with changemakers like wildlife advocate Ye Huang and Cong Du, founder of the Chi Heng Foundation. Crafting each piece taught me to blend rigor and empathy: researching complex issues, distilling them into compelling narratives, and coordinating a team to deliver polished, timely content.

When I step away from screens, you’ll often find me at a Broadway show (I have a soft spot for a cappella harmonies), exploring great food, or traveling to new cities.
